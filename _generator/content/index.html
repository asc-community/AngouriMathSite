<h2 class="centered"><a name="about" href="#about" class="anchor">What is AngouriMath?</a></h2>
<hr/>
<p>
    AngouriMath is an open source symbolic algebra library. That is, via AngouriMath, you can
    automatically solve equations, systems of equations, work with sets, differentiate, parse
    from string, and try many other features.
</p>
<p>
    It is not a CAS, so you can use it in any your project by installing it from <a
        href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngouriMath">NuGet</a>. AngouriMath can be used in
    calculators, algebra systems, educational/quiz apps, graphics, TeX rendering applications,
    etc.
</p>
<p>
    It is free to use even in commercial projects. We work on it a lot, so your requests on <a
        href="https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/issues">issues</a> are likely to be
    considered within a few hours. The project is developed by <a href="https://angouri.org">Angouri</a> and outside contributors.

<!--Parsing from string-->
<div class="block">

<hr>
<p>
    AngouriMath allows to parse an expression from a string in runtime.
    Not only that, it allows to use some pretty syntax, for example,
    you may omit the multiplication operator or powers.
</p>
<p>
    Many
    mathematical objects may be parsed from a syntax which you normally
    write outside of algebra systems!

<!--Evaluate &amp; Simplify-->
<div class="block">
<h3 class="centered"><a name="eval" href="#eval" class="anchor">Evaluate &amp; Simplify</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Of course, you can evaluate expressions here to a number, boolean,
    or other types depending on your expression. As well as for many
    other functions, this is available as a method of Entity or
    as an extension.
</p>
<p>
    You can also simplify symbolic expressions even if they are not evaluable
    to a number. Just run the Simplify method. If you need a custom simplification
    criterion for the simplifier to follow (e. g. you hate complex numbers),
    you may set it in the runtime settings.

<!--Solving equations-->
<div class="block">
<h3 class="centered"><a name="solver" href="#solver" class="anchor">Solving equations</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
    AM allows to solve equations, inequalities, so-called statements,
    systems of equations, inequalities, unions of equations, etc.
    All you need to use it to know a fairly simple syntax.
</p>
<p>
    But first, let me define word Statement. We call a Statement an expression
    that is true for some values of variables, or false for some other.
    For example, "x + 2 > 0" is a Statement which is true for some x and false
    for others.

<!--Differentiation, Integration, Limits-->
<div class="block">
<h3 class="centered"><a name="calc" href="#calc" class="anchor">Calculus</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
    We can analytically find a derivative, integral, and limit over a variable.
</p>
<p>
    Integration and differentiation is performed via .Integrate and .Differentiate
    respectively, and the only argument is the variable.
</p>
<p>
    Limit takes the variable and the destination (where the variable tends),
    but it <i>might</i> also take the side from which the variable approaches
    the destination.

<div class="block">
<h3 class="centered"><a name="bool" href="#bool" class="anchor">Boolean algebra</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
    As it could have been already noticed, you can work with boolean
    operators and variables in AngouriMath.
</p>
<p>
    Operators are similar to the syntax in python, such that
    "or", "and", "not". Also, there's "xor" and "implies".

<div class="block">
<h3 class="centered"><a name="inter" href="#inter" class="anchor">F# &amp; Jupyter</a></h3>

<p>
    F# is a great functional language, which might be convenient for research and 
    scripting. Install AngouriMath.Interactive so that you can use it from both
    F# scripts and Jupyter Notebook.

If you already installed <a href="https://jupyter.org/install">Jupyter</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/NotebooksLocalExperience.md">Interactive</a>
for it, install <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngouriMath.Interactive">package</a>

<!--Multithreading-->
<div class="block">
<h3 class="centered"><a name="multi" href="#multi" class="anchor">Multithreading</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
    You are guaranteed that all functions in AM run in one thread. It is also guaranteed that you can safely run multiple functions from AM in different threads, that is, all static variables and lazy properties are thread-safe.
</p>
<p>
    There is also support of cancellation a task. However, to avoid injecting the cancellation token argument into all methods, we use AsyncLocal<T> instead. That is why instead of passing your token to all methods what you need is to pass it once to the MathS Multithreading SetLocalCancellationToken (CancellationToken) method.
</p>
<details><summary>Example</summary>

<pre><code>var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

// That goes instead of passing your token to methods
MathS.Multithreading.SetLocalCancellationToken(
    cancellationTokenSource.Token);
    
// Then you normally run your task
var currTask = Task.Run(() => InputText.Text.Solve("x"),
    cancellationTokenSource.Token);
    
try
{
    await currTask;
    LabelState.Text = currTask.Result.ToString();
}
catch (OperationCanceledException)
{
    LabelState.Text = "Operation canceled";
}

<h3 class="centered"><a name="whatsnew" href="#whatsnew" class="anchor">What's new</a></h3>

<h3>1.2 Release</h3>

<p>
1.2 brings us incredibly many features, completely reconsidering all patterns. Number of nodes was doubled, 
a lot of syntax related to solvers, building an expression tree, performance improved.
</p>
Not only that, we added <a href="#fsharp">AngouriMath.FSharp</a> and <a href="#inter">AngouriMath.Interactive</a> packages for working in F# and Jupyter respectively.
<p>
<div class="warning">
<b>WARNING</b><br>
1.2 is not backward compatible with 1.1.0.5.
</div>
<br>
We highly recommend reading this if you plan to migrate from 1.1.0.5 to 1.2, as tons of concepts from 1.1.0.5
were reconsidered and rewritten.
</p>
<br>
<h3>General structure</h3><p>

Now there's no operator's name. Moreover, there's no operator anymore. There are records for each separate
logical action, be than a sum operator or sine function. They all are inside <text class="cw">Entity</text>'s naming.
</p><p>
Active functions like renamed <text class="cw">Differentiate</text>, <text class="cw">Integrate</text>, and <text class="cw">Limit</text> now return an expression after <text class="cw">InnerSimplified</text>
being applied. A lot of methods are now properties.
</p><p>
ToSymPy fixed, as well as many other bugs. Solvers and simplificators improved.

<br><br>
</p><h3>Math features</h3><p>

How the math of AM is improved.

<br><br>
</p></p><h4>Secant, Cosecant, Arcsecant, Arccosecant</h4><p>

Are now available as nodes with the obvious syntax and their synonyms.
</p><p>
Secant: <text class="cw">sec(x)</text>
</p><p>
Cosecant: <text class="cw">cosec(x)</text>, <text class="cw">csc(x)</text>
</p><p>
Arcsecant: <text class="cw">asec(x)</text>, <text class="cw">arcsec(x)</text>
</p><p>
Arccosecant: <text class="cw">acsc(x)</text>, <text class="cw">acosec(x)</text>, <text class="cw">arccosec(x)</text>
</p><p>
<br>
</p></p><h4>Hyberbolic trigonometric functions</h4><p>

All trigonometric functions (sin, cos, ..., arcsecant) now have their "-h" pair. For example, <text class="cw">sinh</text>, <text class="cw">cosh</text>, etc.
They are not nodes, but they are parseable and available in AngouriMath.FSharp and AngouriMath.Interactive as well.

<br><br>
</p></p><h4>Abs and Signum and Phi nodes</h4><p>

Abs always returns a real non-negative number for a numerical argument. Signum always returns a complex
number such that its absolute value is 1 for a numerical argument. One exception for signum is 0:
for 0 it returns 0. Phi returns an integer (where Phi is the Euler's totient function).
</p><p>
Syntax for abs: <text class="cw">abs(x)</text>, <text class="cw">(|x|)</text>
</p><p>
Syntax for signum: <text class="cw">sgn(x)</text>, <text class="cw">signum(x)</text>, <text class="cw">sign(x)</text>
</p><p>
Syntax for phi: <text class="cw">phi(x)</text>

<br><br>
</p><h4>Domains</h4><p>

Now every node is constrained within a domain. This init-get-only property is called <text class="cw">Codomain</text>. You can
set this codomain for every node in a given expression. If a numerical value is outside of the codomain,
<text class="cw">Eval</text> will return <text class="cw">NaN</text>, and <text class="cw">Simplify</text> would not take any additional actions, leaving node as it is.
</p><p>
Syntax: <text class="cw">domain(x, ZZ)</text>, <text class="cw">domain(x, QQ)</text>, ...
</p><p>
Note: since domain is not a node, it is true that <text class="cw">domain(x, RR) = domain(domain(x, RR), RR)</text>

<br><br>
</p><h4>Boolean algebra</h4><p>

Now there are many boolean operators added and they are nodes. Instead of <text class="cw">Eval</text> we now see
<text class="cw">EvalNumerical</text> and <text class="cw">EvalBoolean</text>. Likewise, instead of <text class="cw">Evaluable</text> we see <text class="cw">EvaluableNumerical</text>
and <text class="cw">EvaluableBoolean</text>.
</p><p>
Available operators and their syntaxes: <text class="cw">not</text>, <text class="cw">or</text>, <text class="cw">xor</text>, <text class="cw">and</text>, <text class="cw">implies</text>
</p><p>
Syntax of boolean constants: <text class="cw">false</text>, <text class="cw">true</text>

<br><br>
</p><h4>Equality and inequality nodes</h4><p>

Those return a <text class="cw">Boolean</text> when simplified. Inequality nodes result in <text class="cw">NaN</text> if evaluating on two 
numerical non-real values. 
</p><p>
Syntax for equal, greater, less, greater or equal, less or equal: <text class="cw">=</text>, <text class="cw">></text>, <text class="cw"><</text>, <text class="cw">>=</text>, <text class="cw"><=</text>
</p><p>
There's also compositional syntax separately for inequalities and inequalities, e. g.
<text class="cw">x < a < 4</text> <=> <text class="cw">x < a and a < 4</text> and <text class="cw">x = a = b</text> <=> <text class="cw">x = a and a = b</text>. Although you cannot mix
the two, that is, <text class="cw">x < a = c</text> is <text class="cw">(x < a) = c</text> (i. e. the fact whether <text class="cw">x</text> is less than <text class="cw">a</text>
is equivalent to <text class="cw">c</text>)

<br><br>
</p><h4>Sets</h4><p>

Sets are now entities. There're <text class="cw">FiniteSet</text> (which you can iterate over), 
<text class="cw">Interval</text> (from one number to another one. Only reals are now supported),
<text class="cw">SpecialSet</text> (something like domain. Its only parameter is of <text class="cw">Domain</text> type),
<text class="cw">ConditionalSet</text> (for all values in its domain it is true if and only if the
value satisfies the CSet's predicate).
</p><p>
Syntax for finite set: <text class="cw">{ 1, 2, 3 }</text>
</p><p>
Syntax for interval: <text class="cw">('[' | '(') left ';' right (']' | ')')</text>. So the square bracket means it's closed, 
the parenthesis means it's open. For example, <text class="cw">[3; 5)</text> means it is closed on the left end and open on 
the right one.
</p><p>
Syntax for SpecialSet: <text class="cw">CC</text>, <text class="cw">RR</text>, <text class="cw">ZZ</text>, <text class="cw">QQ</text>
</p><p>
Syntax for ConditionalSet: <text class="cw">{ x : predicate(x) }</text> where predicate is a statement, e. g.
<text class="cw">{ x | x > 0 and (y implies x = 0) }</text>
</p><p>
The <text class="cw">in</text> statement allows to verify whether an element belongs to a set. E. g.
<text class="cw">2 in { 2, 3 }</text>

<br><br>
</p><h4>Limits improved</h4><p>

Added some patterns for non-defined expressions, for instance, the first and the second
remarkable limits and a few more. L'Hopital's rule added as well.

<br><br>
</p><h4>Provided</h4><p>

Provided is a node, which turns into NaN if the predicate is false, turns into Expression if the predicate is true. For example,
you may write <text class="cw">5 + (a provided b)</text>. As so, it remains unchanged, but if you subsisute true instead of b, you will get
<text class="cw">5 + (a provided true)</text> -> <text class="cw">5 + a</text>. The whole expression will turn into NaN if any provided's predicate is false.
</p><p>
Exception: when a provided is in a finite set. Then, <text class="cw">(a provided b) in A</text> <=> <text class="cw">(a in A) = b</text>, that is, if a provided turns
into undefined, it's excluded from the finite set.
</p><p>
Syntax: <text class="cw">a provided b</text>. It has the lowest priority, so <text class="cw">a + b \/ c provided f and h = i</text> is the same as <text class="cw">(a + b \/ c) provided (f and h = i)</text>

<br><br>
</p><h4>Piecewise</h4><p>

Piecewise-defined functions are finally added too. They allow you to define conditions under which different expressions
will be substituted. For example, that is how we can define abs function for real x:
<pre><code>Entity abs = "piecewise(x provided x > 0, -x provided x <= 0)";
WriteLine(abs.Substitute("x", 3).EvalNumerical());
WriteLine(abs.Substitute("x", -3).EvalNumerical());
</code></pre>
</p><p>
When a piecewise takes part in an expression, the expression will usually be expanded to piecewise, for example,
<pre><code>piecewise(a provided b, c provided d, ...) + 3
</code></pre>
->
<pre><code>piecewise(a + 3 provided b, c + 3 provided d, ...)
</code></pre>
</p><p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>. The definition of AM's piecewise differs from the classical one.
For the classical math one, piecewise turns into some case if this case's condition is true and all others are false.
In AM's definition, piecewise turns into some case if this case's condition is true and all those *before* the considered
case are false.
</p><p>
Syntax: <text class="cw">piecewise(a provided b, c provided d, ...)</text> if no otherwise case provided.
<text class="cw">piecewise(a provided b, c provided d, ..., e)</text> for <text class="cw">e</text> as the otherwise case.
</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Industrial features</h3><p>

Features, related to industrial integration, production, researches. Usually, improved convenience or stability.

<br><br>
</p><h4>Ultimate exception class added</h4><p>

It is called <text class="cw">AngouriMathBaseException</text>, so that you can catch all exceptions thrown by AngouriMath by catching just one.

<br><br>
</p><h4>Performance improved</h4><p>

See <a href="https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath/blob/master/Sources/AngouriMath/Docs/WhatsNew/version_performance_control.md">Performance report</a>

<br><br>
</p><h4><a id="fsharp"></a>F# in AngouriMath</h4><p>

Now you can work with AngouriMath from F# without writing your own wrapper and work with AM's types directly. Check samples
and readme to get more information

<br><br>
</p><h4><a id="inter"></a>Interactive</h4><p>

Now you can work in Jypyter with expressions being rendered directly to the output. See samples and readme for more information

<br><br>
</p><h4>Multithreading</h4><p>

Some methods like <text class="cw">Solve</text> and <text class="cw">Simplify</text> might take up to infinitely much time. Now, you can kill hung tasks.

<br><br>
</p><h4>New settings</h4><p>

Now, you don't have to pass a lambda. Instead, use syntax

<pre><code>using var _ = MaxExpansionTermCount.Set(10);
// do what is needed
</code></pre>

<text class="cw">Set</text> generates a disposable struct, which, when disposed, rolls back the setting at the end of the scope.
It is not recommended to dispose it your own, just let runtime do its job. The <text class="cw">As</text>, <text class="cw">Global</text>, 
and <text class="cw">RollBackToDefault</text> are marked as <text class="cw">obsolete</text> and not recommended to use anymore.
