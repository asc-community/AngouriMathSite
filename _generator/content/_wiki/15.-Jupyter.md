Here we will cover usage of the library for research purposes.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/interactive">dotnet/interactive</a>, AM
is now convenient to use in Jupyter notebooks. Provided that you already installed
both Jupyter and dotnet/interactive, this is the way you enable Jupyter's features
for AM:

```fs
#r "nuget:AngouriMath.Interactive, *-*"
```

It is highly likely that there will be more features specific for Jupyter in AM.
