Analytical differentation is available in AngouriMath.

<h2>Differentiation</h2>

This is fairly simple process of analytical computations of a derivative of an
expression over one variable. To perform it, call method `Differentiate`. Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "a x ^ 2 + b sin(x) + c";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Differentiate("x"));
```
Output:
```
2 * x * a + cos(x) * b
```

If no derivative can be found, it will return node `Entity.Derivativef`. It might
happen if the differentiated expression is not numerical, for example:
```cs
Entity expr = "a and x";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Differentiate("x"));
```
Output:
```
derivative(a and x, x)
```
It will also happen with subexpressions when they cannot be evaluated. For example,
```cs
Entity expr = "{ 1, 2 } + sin(x)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Differentiate("x"));
```
Output:
```
derivative({ 1, 2 }, x) + cos(x)
```

You can also use this node in your expressions, and if the first argument of this node
is a numerical node, then `InnerSimplified` and `Simplify` will execute differentiation.
Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "x derivative(sin(x) + a x, x) + 16";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Simplify());
```
Output:
```cs
16 + (cos(x) + a) * x
```

You can also pass the third argument. It reflects the number of sequential differentiation
of the same expression. Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "derivative(sin(x), x, 2)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Simplify());
Entity expr2 = "derivative(derivative(sin(x), x), x)";
Console.WriteLine(expr2.Simplify().InnerSimplified);
```
Output:
```cs
-sin(x)
-sin(x)
```
In other words, `derivative(sin(x), x, 2)` is the second derivative of sin(x) or derivative of sin(x)
of order 2.

Extension: `string.Differentiate(Variable)`.
