Many of functions are MathS' methods where MathS is a public static class. All its methods are documented in the code.

<h2>MathS</h2>

It is the main static class for functions. Some of them create new nodes, like `MathS.Sin`, `MathS.Var`, and others.
Functions like `MathS.Hyperbolic.Sinh` create an expression according to its symbolic definition.

Method `FromString` parses a string and returns an expression. For example,
```cs
using static AngouriMath.MathS;
var expr = FromString("x + 2");
```
Would return the same result as
```cs
Entity expr = "x + 2";
```
Method `FromString` uses caching by string. If you need to save memory or confident that
expressions will never repeat, then you may want to disable it like this:
```cs
var expr = FromString("a + x", useCache: false);
```
Then it will not look up for cache neither it will cache the result. The implicit operator
from string does use the cache.
Note, that this method, as well as the implicit operator, will not simplify the result.

Method `ToString` returns a mathematical representation of the given expression.
Although in most cases it will return an expression that can be parsed from string
back into an `Entity`, there is no guarantee so far that it will not change.
Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "a x + b";
Console.WriteLine(expr);
```
Output:
```
a * x + b
```

Method `Latexise` returns a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>
code that can be then rendered into an image.
Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "a / b + sqrt(c)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Latexise());
```
Output:
```
\frac{a}{b}+\sqrt{c}
```

Extensions: `string.Latexise()`, `string.ToEntity()`.
