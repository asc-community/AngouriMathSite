Here we shall review different ways to solve equations, inequalities, statements, systems.

<h2>Solving a classic equation</h2>

The method to solve a classic equation over a single variable in AM is `SolveEquation`.
Since an equation generally has a form of `f(x) = g(x)`, the method `SolveEquation` expects
your expression to be `f(x) - g(x)`, that is, it should be a function. Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "2sin(a x) - b";
Console.WriteLine(expr.SolveEquation("x"));
```
Output:
```cs
{ (arcsin(b / 2) + 2 * pi * n_1) / a, (pi - arcsin(b / 2) + 2 * pi * n_1) / a }
```

Nonetheless, AM allows you to solve `Statement`s, be that equalities, inequalities, and more advanced cases.

Extension: `string.SolveEquation(Variable)`.

<h2>Solving a statement</h2>

A `Statement` is an expression, that is considered to be true or false.
For example, `a and b` is a statement, as well as `x2 = 4`, or `x > a and x2 = b`.

Let us start from a simple example:
```cs
Entity expr = "x2 = 16";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Solve("x"));
```
Output:
```
{ 4, -4 }
```

Here is a more advanced example:
```cs
Entity expr = "x4 = 16 and x in RR and x > 0";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Solve("x"));
```
Output:
```
{ 2 }
```

Adding another condition:
```cs
Entity expr = "x4 = 16 and x in RR and x > 0 or x^a = 6";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Solve("x"));
```
Output:
```
{ 2, 6 ^ (1 / a) }
```

Example with inequalities:
```cs
Entity expr = "2x2 - 3 > 0 and x > 0";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Solve("x").Simplify());
Entity expr2 = "2x2 - 3 > 0 or x > 0";
Console.WriteLine(expr2.Solve("x").Simplify());
```
Output:
```
((-oo; -sqrt(24) / 4) \/ (sqrt(24) / 4; +oo)) /\ (0; +oo)
(-oo; -sqrt(24) / 4) \/ (sqrt(24) / 4; +oo) \/ (0; +oo)
```

Extension: `string.Solve(Variable)`.


The returned value is a `Set`, which could be of four types: `FiniteSet`, `Interval`, `SpecialSet`, `ConditionalSet`. Let us consider
a basic example:
```cs
Entity expr = "a x2 + b x + c = 0";
var solutions = expr.Solve("x");
if (solutions is Entity.Set.FiniteSet finiteSet)
{
    foreach (var root in finiteSet)
        Console.WriteLine($"Root: {root}");
}
```
Output:
```cs
Root: (-b - sqrt(b ^ 2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)
Root: (-b + sqrt(b ^ 2 - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a)
```

<h2>Solving system of equations</h2>

Every equation of the system should be written as a simple equation
(as in the first part of the article). The method of `MathS` named `Equations`:
```cs
var system = Equations(
    "x2 + a y3",
    "y - x - b"
);
```
This creates an instance of `EquationSystem`. Let us print it out:
```cs
Console.WriteLine(system);
```
Output:
```
x ^ 2 + a * y ^ 3 = 0
y - x - b = 0
```

The method `Solve()` of instance `EquationSystem` takes variables in the same order,
as their values are then written to a solution matrix.
Let us consider a very simple example:
```cs
var system = Equations(
    "x2 + y",
    "y - x - 3"
);
Console.WriteLine(system.Solve("x", "y"));
```
Output:
```
Matrix[2 x 2]
(1 - sqrt(-11)) / (-2)          -((1 - sqrt(-11)) / (-2)) ^ 2
(1 + sqrt(-11)) / (-2)          -((1 + sqrt(-11)) / (-2)) ^ 2
```
The first (left) column are values for `x`, the right one for `y`. The first row
is the first solution set, the second row is the second one.
