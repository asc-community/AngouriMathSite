Analytical integration is available in AngouriMath.

<h2>Integration</h2>

Similarly to differentation, here you call method `Integrate`:
```cs
Entity expr = "a x2 + b x";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Integrate("x"));
```
Output:
```
a * x ^ 3 / 3 + b * x ^ 2 / 2
```

If no integral can be found, it will return a node of integral. Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "{ x, a }";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Integrate("x"));
```
Output:
```
integral({ x, a }, x)
```

Same way as with derivative, you can use node `Entity.Integralf` inside an expression:
```cs
Entity expr = "integral(x2 + sin(x), x)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Simplify());
```
Output:
```
x ^ 3 / 3 - cos(x)
```

Extension: `string.Integrate(Variable)`.
