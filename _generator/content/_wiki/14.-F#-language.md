Here we will cover usage of the library for research purposes.

<h2>Usage</h2>

The library has its <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngouriMath.FSharp/">wrapper</a> 
for the F# language. This makes it easier to use the library for projects, written in
F#. Example:
```fs
open Functions
open AngouriMath
open Core

printfn "%O" (asNumber "2 + 3")
printfn "%O" (``dy/dx`` "x2 + a x")
printfn "%O" (``int [dx]`` "x2 + e")
printfn "%O" (``lim x->0`` "sin(a x) / x")
```
Output:
```
5
2 * x + a
x ^ 3 / 3 + e * x
a
```


Nonetheless, you still can call methods from the C# library itself in your code.
