Here we will cover using AngouriMath in real projects, where it is important to provide safety and security.

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

Every exception thrown by AngouriMath is derived from `AngouriMathBaseException`. Although we still
recommend catching particular exceptions rather than catching this one, it is important to be able
to catch all exceptions thrown by a library.

`AngouriBugException` is thrown when an internal error occured in AngouriMath. It is almost certainly
that the error happened on AM's side, so we ask you to report about it to the official repository if it
happens. It will help us fix it quickly and release an update sooner.

`FutureReleaseException` is thrown when the required feature is not implemented yet. If you encoutered
this exception, make sure that you are on the latest version. If you are, probably it only remains to
wait for the feature. Nonetheless, feel free to make a feature request to let us know that it is needed.

All exceptions are documented, so if encountered an unknown one, we recommend you checking it on the
Almanac or documentation in-code.
