Another topic of basic calculus are limits, both one- and two-sided.

<h2>Two-sided limits</h2>

The first method to find limits is method `Limit(Variable, Entity)`. Example:
```cs
Entity expr = "(a x3 + b x2 + c) / (h x3 - b x - 1)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Limit("x", "+oo"));
```
Output:
```
a / h
```
That is, as the first argument a variable should be passed, and its destination - as the second argument.

Symbols `+oo` and `-oo` are parsed as real positive and real negative infinities respectively.

Not only it works with rational functions, here are a few examples of more advanced cases.
Example:
```cs
// First remarkable
Entity expr = "sin(a x) / x";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Limit("x", "0"));

// First remarkable
Entity expr2 = "sin(a x) / tan(b x)";
Console.WriteLine(expr2.Limit("x", "0"));

// Second remarkable
Entity expr3 = "(1 + a / x)^(d x)";
Console.WriteLine(expr3.Limit("x", "+oo"));

// l'Hopital's rule
Entity expr4 = "(tan(t) - sin(t)) / t3";
Console.WriteLine(expr4.Limit("t", "0"));
```
Output:
```
a
a / b
e ^ (a * d)
1/2
```

If a limit cannot be found, a note of `Entity.Limitf` is returned:
```cs
Entity expr = "(sin(t) - tan(t)) / t";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Limit("t", "+oo"));
```
Output:
```
limit((sin(t) - tan(t)) / t, t, +oo)
```

Extension: `string.Limit(Variable, Entity)`

<h2>One-sided limits</h2>

The method is `Limit(Variable, Entity, AngouriMath.Core.ApproachFrom)`,
where `ApproachFrom` is a `enum` of three possible values: `BothSides`, `Left`, `Right`.
If `BothSided` is passed, it will work same as `Limit(Variable, Entity)`.
Otherwise, we shall consider now. Simple example:
```cs
Entity expr = "(a x2 + b) / (c x2 + d)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Limit("x", "3", AngouriMath.Core.ApproachFrom.Left));
```
Output:
```
(a * 9 + b) / (c * 9 + d)
```

Another example:
```cs
Entity expr = "(a x2 + b) / (c x2 + d)";
Console.WriteLine(expr.Limit("x", "0", AngouriMath.Core.ApproachFrom.Left));
```
Output:
```
b / d
```

Extension: `string.Limit(Variable, Entity, ApproachFrom)`.
